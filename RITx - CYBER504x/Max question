snort
Metasploit
*ARP
P packets exist at _______ of the OSI Model.
Layer 2
*Layer 3
Layer 4
Layer 5

True or False: Attackers can use their packet sniffers to sniff on a different network.
True
*False

Differences between Promiscuous mode and Monitor mode include: (Select two)
*In promiscuous mode the NIC passes all traffic it receives up the network stack.
*Monitor mode allows a computer with a wireless NIC to monitor all traffic from the wireless network.
Monitor mode works only on wireless networks, while promiscuous mode works only on wired networks.
Promiscuous mode works only on wireless networks, while Monitor mode can be used on both wired and wireless networks.

A deficiency of WinPcap for Windows is that it:
Cannot bypass the protocol stack
Cannot set up promiscuous mode
*Does not support monitor mode
Does not support remote packet capture
A hypervisor: (Select two)

Can add a Layer 3 IP header to ARP frames
Cannot replace the source MAC address in the Ethernet header of an outgoing packet
*Can examine ARP and DHCP traffic to learn the IP addresses of virtual machines
*Can force a wired physical NIC to accept a frame with a VMâ€™s MAC address

The three panes shown in the Wireshark capture window are:
Packet Addresses
*Packet Bytes
*Packet Details
*Packet List

True or False: Saved Wireshark data captures cannot be viewed interactively with filters.
True
*False

True or False: If you want to use a capture filter, it must be set before you start sniffing.
*True
False

Without any cached ARP entries, after sending a ping to a destination on a different network, the ARP request looks for:
The MAC address of the destination
The IP address of the default gateway
*The MAC address of the default gateway
The destination IP address

The difference in ICMP Echo Requests sent from your machine, when pinging a local destination vs. a remote destination was:
*Destination MAC address
Destination IP address
Source MAC address
Source IP addres

The difference in ICMP Echo Replies sent to your machine, when pinging a local destination vs. a remote destination was:
*Source MAC address
Source IP address
Destination MAC address
Destination IP address

Which string do you use to filter for DNS queries and replies involving your client machine?
tcp
bootp
dhcp
*dns

Which string do you use to filter for DHCP traffic to and from your client machine?
dhcp
dns
tcp
*bootp

#Unit 2
Which of these is the best choice for a function for hashing passwords?
*PBKDF2
SHA-256
SHA-512
SHA-1

True or False: Both Windows and Linux systems automatically store passwords as hashes by default.
*True
False

Recent password guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), included:
Time recommendations for password changes
Requiring use of special characters and symbols in passwords
*Screening passwords against lists of known compromised passwords
Requiring passwords to be at least 12 characters long

True or False: Brute Force attacks compare hashes of password combinations rather than the passwords themselves to look for matches.
*True
False

rockyou.txt is:
An algorithm to replace characters in words (such as 0 for o)
*A large file containing known passwords
A program that generates likely passwords from a targets name, birth date, and other information
A file of known password hashes

he advantage of a Dictionary attack over a Brute Force attack is that: (select two)
It is generated based on information about a known target
*It can take much less time
It starts with known password hashes
*It uses words rather than random combinations

A rainbow table uses: (select two)
Less processing than a dictionary attack
Less storage than a brute force attack
*More processing than a dictionary attack
*More storage than a brute force attack

A rainbow table produces:
Pairs of plaintext passwords and reductions
Hashes of a list of plaintext passwords that is then discarded
Pairs of plaintext passwords and hashes
*A chain of alternating hashes and plaintexts

Despite its length, a rainbow table only stores:
The first and last rows
Matching passwords and hashes
*The first and last columns
Hashes, not passwords

Rainbow tables try to match: (Select two)
*A password in the last column of the table
The hash of the first password in the table
*The last computed reduction function
The original plaintext password

Salt is:
*Random bits input into the hashing algorithm with the password
Random bits encrypted along with the password
Random bits generated by the hashing algorithm
Random bits added to the hashed password

True or False: Salts are stored as plaintext.
*True
False

Security mistakes by Yahoo! that were revealed through data breaches on the company included: (Select all that apply)
Allowing too many employees access to user data
*Storing passwords as plaintext
*Storing usernames as plaintext
*Using old hash algorithms

Which of these attacks is crunch not meant for?
*Rainbow table attack
Dictionary attack
Brute force attack

-o in a crunch command:
Replaces a known character with an optional character
Confines characters to a particular order
*Outputs the generated list as a file
Restricts the list to known words

The character @ in a crunch command represents:
*A placeholder for any character
A character string
A random set of characters
A placeholder for a specific set of characters

-p in a crunch command:
Enforces a certain order among characters
Enables repeated characters or words
Prints the list
*Eliminates repeated characters or words

To see approximately how long it will take to crack a password in with John the Ripper, use the command:
john --trial
john --sample
john --time
*john --test

John uses single-crack mode when: (Select two)
*It is not using a wordlist
*It is using GECOS information
The password is 12 characters or less
It is trying to find a hash rather than a password

The unshadow command combines which files: (Select two)
/etc/gecos
/etc/john
*/etc/passwd
*/etc/shadow

Which of the following is true regarding rockyou.txt and the default John wordlist?
rockyou.txt is slightly smaller than the default John wordlist
rockyou.txt is slightly larger than the default John wordlist
rockyou.txt is significantly smaller than the default John wordlist
*rockyou.txt is significantly larger than the default John wordlist

True or False: When using ophcrack, you can see the rainbow tables as they are generated.
True
*False

Which command will generate a wordlist that starts at a and ends at zzzzz ?
crunch zzzzz a
crunch 5 1
crunch a zzzzz
*crunch 1 5

Which command will display a wordlist using the character set abcdefgh that starts at a and ends at hhhhhh?
*crunch 1 6 abcdefgh
crunch a hhhhhh
crunch 1 8 abcdefgh
crunch hhhhhh a

Linux stores its passwords in which file?
SAM
*/etc/shadow
/etc/secret
/etc/passwd

John the Ripper:
Always uses a wordlist
Never uses a wordlist
*Can be used with or without a wordlist

True or False: The John the Ripper wordlist has more words than rockyou.txt.
True
*False

True or False: rockyou.txt can't be used with John the Ripper.
True
*False

Ophcrack cracks windows passwords using:
/etc/shadow
rockyou.txt
*Rainbow Tables
John the Ripper

True or False: Using Ophcrack is more efficient for cracking passwords than a brute force attack.
*True
False
